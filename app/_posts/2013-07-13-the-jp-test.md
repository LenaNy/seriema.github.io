title: The JP test
---

Hopefully most recruiters are aware of the awesome [Joel Test]() for finding _great_ developers. After six years in the consultancy business I've seen things that would make me fire them on the spot, if I was their boss. So I devised a heuristic to find _bad_ developers quickly and get them out of the hiring process ASAP.

When I say _bad_, I mean so bad that they should rethink their career path and remove any mention of the word "programmer" from their CV (onless it's preceeded by the words "not a"). The things I list make me laugh, but I've seen every single one on a "developers" machine.

You want to waste as little of your and their time as possible. So this test is constructed to minimize TTGTFO (Time-To Get The Fuck Out).

## Before coming into the office, through e-mails

1. Ask for the name of their _current_ side/hobby project.
  a. If they don't have one, have they recently become a parent? Yes: ok, No: GTFO. Alternative: who cares? GTFO
1. Ask them for their online dev or project-related profiles, like Github or StackExchange.
  a. They don't have one, GTFO
1. Ask them what their latest dev related book they read is.
  a. They don't remember because it was so long ago, GTFO

1. Ask them for their dev computer spec.
  a. If they don't know, GTFO
1. Ask them for a fullscreen screenshot of their browser. It should be their dev computer, regardless if it's home or work computer.  Don't be more specific, this tests their mindset.
  a. If they send the image inside a Word or Powerpoint document, GTFO
  a. If it's Internet Explorer, GTFO
  a. If it has toolbars, GTFO
1. Ask them for a fullscreen screenshot of their most used IDE.
  a. If they ask what that is, GTFO
  a. If the trial has expired and it's not usable, GTFO
  a. If it has your favorite plugin(s), bonus points
1. Ask them for a full list of installed applications. All of it.
  a. If it has bloatware, GTFO
  a. If it has a gazillion applications, GTFO
  a. If it doesn't have something you think is vital, GTFO
  a. If it has Photoshop or equivalent, bonus points


## During office meeting, face to face

1. Ask them to bring a laptop
  a. If they don't, GTFO
1. Ask them to start their favorite IDE
  a. If they struggle, GTFO
  a. If it's not an IDE or text editor, GTFO
1. Ask them to write FizzBuzz in their favorite language. Watch them code.
  a. If they already knew what it was, bonus points
  a. If they struggle in finding basic commands, GTFO
  a. If they use keyboard shortcuts, bonus points
  a. If they don't indent their code, GTFO
  a. If they're not done, or almost done, in 15min, GTFO
1. Ask them if they can think of any improvements to their FizzBuzz solution.
  a. If they can't think of any, GTFO

If the person is still in the race, congrats. It's not a total idiot. :) Now you can start the _real_ tests, which are up to you.


## Joke test
1. Ask them for their APM in SC and/or SC2
  a. They don't know what that is, GTFO
1. Ask them for a nerd joke
  a. You don't snicker, GTFO
1. C++ or JavaScript?
  a. If they don't ask for more info or say "it depends", GTFO
1. Ask them for their favorite nerdcore artist(s)
  a. They don't know what that is, GTFO
